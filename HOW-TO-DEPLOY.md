# How to Deploy and Share Your Calendar Page

## Quick Start

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended - Free & Easy)

1. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section in the left sidebar
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose your branch (e.g., `main` or `copilot/fix-...`)
   - Click "Save"

2. **Your Shareable Link Will Be:**
   ```
   https://criz-007.github.io/agnus-ebin-betrothal/
   ```
   
3. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for GitHub Pages to build and deploy your site

4. **Share this link** with everyone via:
   - WhatsApp
   - Email
   - SMS
   - Social Media
   - Wedding invitations

### Option 2: Netlify (Alternative - Also Free)

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Connect your repository
5. Deploy!
6. You'll get a link like: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

### Option 3: Quick Test Locally

To test the page on your computer:
1. Download the `index.html` file
2. Double-click to open it in your browser
3. This is just for testing - you can't share this link

## Adding the Background Image

To add your floral background image:

1. **Download the image** from: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/926cf672-e1b5-4488-bc77-ae59ec1069bc

2. **Save it** in the same folder as `index.html` with the name: `background.jpg`

3. The page is already configured to use it automatically!

**Note:** The HTML file already has a beautiful gradient fallback if the image file is not found.

## Sharing the Link

Once you've deployed using GitHub Pages or Netlify:

### ✅ DO:
- Share the deployed URL (e.g., `https://criz-007.github.io/agnus-ebin-betrothal/`)
- Test the link yourself first before sharing
- Share via any messaging platform (WhatsApp, Email, SMS, etc.)

### ❌ DON'T:
- Share a local file path (like `C:\Users\...` or `file:///...`)
- Share the GitHub repository link (that's for code, not the calendar page)

## Troubleshooting

### Background image not showing?
1. Make sure `background.jpg` is in the same folder as `index.html`
2. The gradient fallback will show if the image is missing (still looks great!)
3. After deploying, wait a minute and refresh the page

### Calendar buttons not working?
1. All calendar buttons work directly from the deployed page
2. Some may require you to be logged into that calendar service
3. Test with Google Calendar first - it's the most reliable

## Need Help?

If you need assistance:
1. Make sure you've followed the GitHub Pages steps exactly
2. Wait 1-2 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
3. Try opening the link in an incognito/private browser window
4. Clear your browser cache if needed
